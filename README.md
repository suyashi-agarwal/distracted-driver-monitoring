## üìñ About the Project

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to enhance road safety by detecting mobile phone usage by drivers in real-time.
Leveraging a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 deep learning model, the system processes in-cabin visual data to identify signs of distraction, providing a foundation for creating timely alerts.
The pipeline covers the entire ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation, adhering to MLOps principles for maintainability and continuous improvement.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-time Distraction Detection**: Trained to identify drivers using a mobile phone and whether they are wearing a seatbelt or not.
* **State-of-the-Art Model**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture, which is recognized for its high accuracy and speed.
* **Data Processing Pipeline**: Includes Python scripts for preprocessing raw visual data, including denoising and resizing, to prepare it for training.
* **Ethical Considerations**: The project acknowledges the importance of ethical AI, including data privacy and the prevention of algorithmic bias.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.11**
* **YOLOv8** (via Ultralytics)
* **PyTorch**
* **OpenCV**
* **Google Colab** (for GPU-accelerated training)
* **Git & GitHub**

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

Here are the steps to set up and run this project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Git

### 2. Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python ultralytics
    ```
4.  **Download the Data:**
    * Download the required dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-FARM-distracted-driver-detection.
    * Place the data in the `data/raw/` directory according to the structure specified in the `prepare_data.py` script.

### 3. Usage

1.  **Prepare the data:**
    ```sh
    python prepare_data.py
    ```
2.  **Train the model:**
    * Upload the `processed` data to a cloud environment like Google Colab.
    * Run the training command:
        ```sh
        yolo train model=yolov8s.pt data=driver_dataset.yaml epochs=100 batch=16
        ```
3.  **Run inference:**
    ```sh
    yolo predict model=path/to/your/best.pt source=path/to/test_video.mp4
    ```

## üìà Future Work

The operationalization of this system would require a strong commitment to MLOps principles. Future steps include:
* **Deployment**: Containerizing the application using Docker for deployment on an embedded system or cloud service[cite: 168].
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Implementing a monitoring system to track model performance and detect data drift over time[cite: 170, 171].
* **Automated Retraining**: Establishing a CI/CD pipeline for automatically retraining and deploying the model when performance degrades[cite: 187, 188].
