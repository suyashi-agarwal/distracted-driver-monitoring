# In-Cabin Driver Monitoring for Phone Distraction Detection

## üìñ About the Project

[cite_start]This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to enhance road safety by detecting mobile phone usage by drivers in real-time[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Leveraging a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 deep learning model, the system processes in-cabin visual data to identify signs of distraction, providing a foundation for creating timely alerts[cite: 4, 51]. [cite_start]The pipeline covers the entire ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation, adhering to MLOps principles for maintainability and continuous improvement[cite: 34].

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-time Distraction Detection**: Trained to identify drivers using a mobile phone.
* [cite_start]**State-of-the-Art Model**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture, which is recognized for its high accuracy and speed[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]**Data Processing Pipeline**: Includes Python scripts for preprocessing raw visual data, including denoising and resizing, to prepare it for training[cite: 81, 85, 87].
* [cite_start]**Ethical Considerations**: The project acknowledges the importance of ethical AI, including data privacy and the prevention of algorithmic bias[cite: 6].

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.11**
* **YOLOv8** (via Ultralytics)
* **PyTorch**
* **OpenCV**
* **Google Colab** (for GPU-accelerated training)

    ```

## üìà Future Work

[cite_start]The operationalization of this system would require a strong commitment to MLOps principles[cite: 228]. Future steps include:
* [cite_start]**Deployment**: Containerizing the application using Docker for deployment on an embedded system or cloud service[cite: 168].
* [cite_start]**Continuous Monitoring**: Implementing a monitoring system to track model performance and detect data drift over time[cite: 170, 171].
* [cite_start]**Automated Retraining**: Establishing a CI/CD pipeline for automatically retraining and deploying the model when performance degrades[cite: 187, 188].
